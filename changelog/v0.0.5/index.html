        <p>This is a bug-fix release for an issue with cross-platform line endings that affected
users who installed cargo-dist with <code>cargo install</code>. Prebuilt binaries were unaffected.
Specifically folks reported in [#181] that they were seeing the Shell installer (for Mac and Linux)
be generated with mixed CRLF and LF line endings, which was causing both functionality
and development issues (git churn).</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar- the line endings on Windows machines are different than those
on Mac and Linux ones and it can cause a lot of unfortunate chaos.</p>
<p>There are 2 styles of control characters to mark a line break in a text file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LF</code>, (<code>\n</code>), Linux/Mac: <code>LF</code> stands for "Line Feed"</li>
<li><code>CRLF</code>, (<code>\r\n</code>), Windows: <code>CR</code> stands for "Carriage Return"</li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of CRLF line endings in a shell script will cause issues. Similarly LF
line endings in a powershell script will cause issues. (Citation needed on the powershell
thing but sure let's play it safe/idiomatic here.)</p>
<p>The problem was that the <code>.crate</code> uploaded to crates.io had CRLF endings in some templates
because <code>cargo publish</code> was run on windows and the git repo was configured to checkout files
with platform-specific endings. The prebuilt binaries were checked out and built on linux
(Github CI), and so only used LF endings.</p>
<p>The reason we got <em>mixed</em> LF and CRLF is because the contents of the installer scripts come from
mixed sources: the bulk comes from template files on disk, but a few key lines are injected
programmatically by rust code with <code>writeln</code> (and <code>write</code> with manual <code>\n</code>). Note that Rust's
println/writeln are guaranteed to emit LF on all platforms (because really CRLF should just be
fazed out and platform-specific writeln would be a mess). This was good and desirable, the
main screw up was the line endings in the stored template being forwarded verbatim instead
of all being rewritten to LF.</p>
<p>To be EXTRA SURE this doesn't happen in the future we just straight up rewrite all newlines
before writing the final result, making the newlines stored in cargo-dist's git repo irrelevant.</p>
